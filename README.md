# Analysis of Amazon Vine Reviews

### Overview of Analysis
An analysis was conducted on book reviews in AWS. The analysis was conducted to compare paid book reviews compared to unpaid reviews. With the book review data that was chosen there were thousands of unpaid book reviews however very few paid reviews. When the data was filtered to be able to analyze it there were no paid reviews left to analyze. 

### Results
After filtering of the data:
- There were a total of 375353 unpaid reviews. 
- Of the unpaid reviews there were a total of 226910 5-star; which is 60% of all reviews. 
- Of the unpaid reviews there were a total of 62941 1 and 2 star reviews; which is 17% of all reviews.

### Summary
In this data there were no paid vine reviews to compare so we do not know if having a review be paid would have caused there to be a bias in the results. In general reviews tend to favor the more extreme views of a product (whether positive or negative). We can hypothesize that by paying individuals to write a review it would increase the number of individuals with less extreme views on the product to write a review.
